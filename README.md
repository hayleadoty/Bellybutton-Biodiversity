# Bellybutton-Biodiversity

## Overview of the Project

After collecting samples of belly button bacteria from various volunteers, our job was to take the data obtained and visualize it. We created a dashboard where the user can choose a test subject ID from a dropdown menu in order to delve deeper into the data. Once the subject ID has been selected by the user, three visualizations are depicted for that subject: their top 10 bacteria cultures, the different types (and amounts) of bacteria cultures in their sample, and the frequency of the subject's belly button cleanings per week. The user is also provided with a demographics chart for the test subject, which provides a vague snapshot of their background.
